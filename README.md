Hello. This is ITBJuicers. To be able to try this prototype, you will have to fulfill these prequisites:
- Download an IDE (e.g. VS Studio)
- Install Flask google-generativeai python-dotenv
- Gemini model used : gemini-2.0-flash

Keep in mind that we are a group of new people in the world of coding so we have a level of understanding in programming concepts and its implementations that isn't good.
However, we still tried our best in joining this challenge. So, we apologize for our weaknesses and drawbacks. Anyway, I hope you (the one who is reading this) can try our project.
